# Emotion-Detection
Emotion Detection is an advanced field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Computer Vision that focuses on identifying and analyzing human emotions from various data sources such as facial expressions, speech, body language, or text. Using Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, emotion detection systems can classify emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality.

**How it Works**

Data Collection – Input is taken in the form of images, video, speech, or text.

Feature Extraction – Key features (like facial landmarks, tone of voice, or text sentiment) are identified.

Classification Model – A trained model (CNN, RNN, Transformer, etc.) classifies emotions into predefined categories.

Prediction & Output – The system displays or acts upon the detected emotional state.

**Applications**

Healthcare – Detecting depression, stress, or mental health issues.

Education – Monitoring student engagement and emotions in e-learning.

Customer Service – AI chatbots recognizing frustration or satisfaction.

Marketing – Analyzing customer emotions towards products/ads.

Security – Identifying suspicious behavior based on emotional cues.
